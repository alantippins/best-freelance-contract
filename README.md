# Best Freelance Contract

That's right, it's the best freelance contract ever. This opinionated contract should be used as a guideline â€“ the way that I do work might not be the same way that you do work, so you should probably read this contract before you send it off to your clients.

**This is currently a work-in-progress and should *not* be used unless you're sure you've fixed everything.**
